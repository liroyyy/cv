  <h3>Writing</h3>
  <div class="writting">
    <p>I have always enjoyed the idea of creating my own world, a place where anything I want can be made possible, a place where heroes are formed when dangers arise. For as long as I can remember I've put pen to paper to write down whatever
      wild world I had thought of. However over the years I've noticed that to write any truly captivating story I need to practice. That was around the same time my idea of
      Sisila of Siladia, the story of a young man on a quest to avenge his family and town, came into existance. This story of mine changed shape and form morphing into something broader than I had ever imagined. The town became a and the city
      became a country, and before I knew it I was writing the history and culture of a whole world. And now I am starting my journey, probably for the hundredth time, into my imaginary World. would you like to come along? Here are two of my
      upcoming books. </p>
